## Who am I?

Hey there! I'm David, currently a Data Scientist at PolyChord in London, where I spend my days applying machine learning to real-world problems that actually need to work in production - crazy concept, I know. My journey took me from PhD student at Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, to postdoc at SISSA in Trieste, and now into industry. During my academic years, I specialized in teaching computers to understand the Universe's baby photos – aka the cosmic 21-cm signal – developing neural networks for optimal compression, generative imaging, and simulation-based inference.

Originally from Croatia, I've traded Mediterranean coastlines for Italian pasta, then Italian coffee for London's... beautiful and sunny weather. With global warming, not far from truth. I've built expertise across the full ML pipeline using PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow, deployed training runs on massive HPC clusters, and survived countless hours debugging models that sometimes even converged on the first try, after 100 iterations. Whether it's score-based diffusion, information maximizing neural networks, or just making sense of complex data, I enjoy tackling problems that sit at the messy intersection of statistics, physics, and computer science.
